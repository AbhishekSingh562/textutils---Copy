This is my first react app successfull deployment! 
The project name is textUtils and you can access it here-"https://abhisheksingh562.github.io/textutils---Copy/"
In this project i created a single page web in which you can paste any para and you can perform some actions on it like if you want to convert all the words into upper case you
can do it by just one click,, and the coolest and my favourite feature in this is speak button,, you can paste any text and you can able to make ypour device to read that para
for you !!
